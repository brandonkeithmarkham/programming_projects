# Vector Operations App (C++)

A console program that generates a vector of integers and performs a series of analyses and transformations:

- Generate `N` random integers in the range **0â€“8**  
- Display the generated vector  
- Show a **two-column report** of duplicate values (value, count), sorted **descending by value**  
- **Remove duplicates** in place (keeping first occurrences) and display the result  
- Display the vector **sorted ascending**
